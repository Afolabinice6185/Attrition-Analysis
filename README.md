Employee attrition isA major challenge for organizations, leading to higher recruitment  costs, loss of skills, and reduced productivity.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to higher recruitment 
costs, loss of skills, and reduced productivity. Understanding why employees leave is 
essential to improving retention, strengthening workforce stability, and supporting longterm growth.
# Key Objectives
1. Measure overall attrition rate and trends across departments, roles, and age groups.
2. Identify the main factors influencing employee attrition (e.g., salary, overtime, job 
role, satisfaction).
3. Highlight employee groups most at risk of leaving the organization.
4. Provide practical recommendations to improve retention and reduce turnover costs.
Key Expectations
â€¢ A clear picture of attrition levels within the company.
â€¢ Insights into the most common reasons employees leave.
â€¢ Identification of high-risk groups (e.g., certain roles, age bands, or tenure levels).
â€¢ A well-designed interactive dashboard to visualize attrition patterns.
â€¢ Actionable recommendations for HR and management to strengthen employee 
retention.

## Transformation Process
ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Process

To ensure accuracy and reliability of the attrition analysis, the following data preparation steps were carried out:

Error Removal

Identified and removed inconsistent or invalid entries (e.g., missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers) to improve data quality.

Duplicate Removal

Checked for and eliminated duplicate records to avoid over-counting and ensure the dataset reflects unique employees.

Data Classification & Grouping

Salary Increases: Categorized into ranges (Low: 11â€“15%, Medium: 16â€“20%, High: 21â€“25%) for clearer analysis.

Departments: Grouped employees by functional areas (HR, R&D, Sales, etc.).

Job Roles: Classified staff into roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Research, Laboratory, Healthcare, Manufacturing).

Satisfaction Scale: Grouped into Low, Medium, and High satisfaction levels for simplicity.

Tenure: Segmented into ranges (1â€“10 years, 11â€“15 years, 16â€“20 years, 21â€“25 years, 25â€“32 years, 33â€“40 years) to analyze attrition by years of service.

Age Groups: Consolidated into categories (Under 25, 25â€“34, 35â€“44, 45â€“54, 55+) to highlight attrition by career stage.

Data Formatting

Standardized column names and ensured consistent formatting across all fields for ease of interpretation in dashboards.

âœ… This structured approach ensured the dataset was clean, well-organized, and analysis-ready, enabling clearer insights into employee attrition trends.

# Overview

Total Attrition Count: 1,470 employees.

Attrition is distributed across different departments, job roles, age groups, tenures, salary and satisfaction levels.

This analysis highlights the main drivers of employee turnover within the organization.

2. Departmental Insights

R&D Department records the highest attrition rate, followed by Sales.

HR has the lowest attrition.
ðŸ‘‰ Indicates technical/research-heavy roles and sales functions may have work pressure or career growth challenges leading to exits.

3. Job Role Analysis

Sales Executives and Research roles are the most affected.

Healthcare reps and manufacturing staff show relatively lower attrition.
ðŸ‘‰ Suggests frontline and research-intensive roles need targeted retention strategies (e.g., better incentives, reduced workload, or career development).

4. Age Group Distribution

25â€“34 years employees are the largest group leaving, followed by 35â€“44 years.

Attrition sharply declines in employees aged 45 and above.
ðŸ‘‰ Indicates that mid-career employees (young professionals) are at higher risk, possibly due to career mobility or dissatisfaction with growth opportunities.

5. Tenure (Years with Company)

Employees with 1â€“10 years tenure form the largest share of attrition.

Attrition reduces significantly after 15 years, becoming negligible after 30 years.
ðŸ‘‰ Suggests employees who stay beyond 15 years are loyal and stable, but early- to mid-tenure employees are more likely to leave.

6. Salary Increase Effect

Majority of attrition is seen in the 11â€“15% (Low) salary increase group.

Attrition decreases in the 16â€“20% (Medium) and 21â€“25% (High) salary increase groups.
ðŸ‘‰ Clear evidence that compensation is a key retention factor.

7. Satisfaction Scale

Staff with Low Satisfaction show the highest attrition.

Attrition reduces for Medium and High Satisfaction groups.
ðŸ‘‰ Suggests employee engagement, workplace culture, and satisfaction programs should be a major HR focus.

8. Time Trend

Attrition has occurred consistently over time, but spikes can be observed at certain points.
ðŸ‘‰ Further analysis by year/quarter could identify specific triggers (e.g., policy changes, leadership shifts, or external market factors).

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways & Recommendations

Focus on Retention in R&D and Sales â€“ improve career development paths, reduce burnout, and introduce incentives.

Address Young & Mid-Career Attrition (25â€“34 yrs, 1â€“10 yrs tenure) â€“ offer mentorship, training, and growth opportunities.

Review Compensation Policies â€“ increase salary increments for lower bands to reduce exits.

Boost Employee Satisfaction â€“ conduct regular surveys, improve work-life balance, and foster a positive culture.

Proactive Workforce Planning â€“ predict and prevent attrition spikes by monitoring trends.
